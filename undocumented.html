		<h2>THE UNDOCUMENTED DAYS</h2>
		<p>The first days of server included the Original Seven: NuggetBro, WamBamSam, UberAndre, LemonDude123, YaBoyPayden, BestBeanBoy, and 
		SassyLemon0127. Spawn included a central array of bases and an ice highway terminal. This would soon determine the main structure of city planning you 
		see on Chulls. The first great bases were constructed in this era, with the Temple and Treehouse being the most notable. The sugarcane farm along the ice
		highway was one of the largest farms at the time. YaBoyPayden was notorious for his wifi troubles. Later on in these days, WamBamSam, NuggetBro, 
		SassyLemon0127, and LemonDude123 made the First Arch.</p>
