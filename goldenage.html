		<h2>THE GOLDEN AGE</h2>
		<p>The Golden Age was easily the most documented and most popular era in Chullian history, containing deep lore and well-preserved accounts of many events. For this era, two worlds will be covered by a player-to-player basis, recapping the major events. Two worlds will be referred in this chapter: Skinny Penis Town world (ab. SPT) and Mt. Chulls World (ab. Mt.C), named after the most famed bases respectively. Other bases include The Greater Mt. Chulls Area, Chico's Dong, The Cottage, and the Windmill.</p>

		<h3>NUGGETBRO: THE MENACE</h3>
		<p>NuggetBro set out to be the most powerful person on the server at all times, often bringing along Prii5m when active. On the SPT world, he would often harass the inhabitants of Skinny Penis Town with his riches and power. He then proceded to drive the remnants of Scott far away before his final, permenant ban. In the Mt.C world, he waged conflicts with Chico and Prii5m against Chullia, a coalition government between SassyLemon0127, powerfulwhale, LemonDude123, and YaBoyPayden. However, with overwhelming resource superiority, NuggetBro won every conflict he entered. The following is an exerpt from the Battle of Mt. Chulls:</p>
		<p class="quote">After receiving a gift from Nuggetshit, I gladly took it but still needed supplies for my horse. He asked for his gift back, but I refused. He became aggravated and formed a coalition with the nearby ChicoGUAPO to raid Mt. Chulls. I escaped on my horse and prepared for battle. While I valiantly defended my base, he bombed everything on his way to the compound. I held him off with my arrows before he killed my horse and finally made a dash up the staircase, which he promptly destroyed. In the last stand, I went up the MCVTS to defend my glass dome. He let off a massive explosion at the summit of Mt. Chulls, completely destroying the domes entrance and severely damaging other structures up top. ChicoGUAPO scaled the side of the mountain. I was cut off, and nuggetSHIT ender pearled to the end of the dome where I fended him off in my weak iron gear while he overpowered me with his full Prot 4 diamond. I decided to end of own life and jump off the destroyed dome. I respawned at the dome several 		times but was killed quickly, and he destroyed the bed, leaving me at spawn. However, this is when the coalition realized a major flaw. I WAS CLOSER TO THEIR BASE SINCE I WAS AT SPAWN. I MADE A DASH TO NUGGETS BASE, WITH NOTHING TO LOSE. I ENTERED HIS BASE AND DESTROYED HIS BED, JUKEBOX AND TOOK MANY VALUABLES. I was then chased by chico, who committed die to come fight me since his spawn point was nearby, and was killed by Chico. Before he ended me, I threw the items from Nuggets base into a nearby cactus. With this, the Chulli-GUAPO conflict ended with a strategic victory for the coalition.</p>

		<h3>YABOYPAYDEN: THE CULTIVATOR</h3>
		<p>Ultimately a force for good after severing ties with Scott, YaBoyPayden would prove to be a mighty builder and creator. His ability to band together groups for a build project was a large reason the original method of city planning remained on Chulls. His works in Skinny Penis Town and the Greater Mt. Chulls area are certainly his greatest yet, as his chapter is far from over.</p>

		<h3>ITZ.WI11: THE MANIPULATOR</h3>
		<p>After cultivating the NW Outpost, itz.wi11 proved himself a worthy builder and capable player. However, his exploits were exposed after he took advantage of a dupe. While the decision was made to keep him on the server, significant faith was lost in the admins. This event ultimately led to the reset of the Mt.C world, marking an end to the Golden Age.</p>

		<h3>CHICO_GUAPO: THE MEMER</h3>
		<p>Undoubtly the most highly memed (Mr. Shale a close second) player, Chico is known for his outrageous build and bipolar attitude. He would do things on a whim, making him the most entertaining to follow in Chulls. He has built countless phallic structures and memes, but his skill as a builder is proved nonetheless.</p>

		<h3>WAMBAMSAM: THE INDIFFERENT</h3>
		<p>WamBamSam is widely known for his builds and long time loyalty to Chulls. His great builds came after the Golden Age era, but he started off with the Cottage on SPT. He is a feirce competitor and protector of his lands, but he is known for his neutrality in conflicts.</p>
