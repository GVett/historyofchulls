		<h2>THE 1.18 WORLD</h2>
		<p>This was the largest resurgence in players since the Golden Age. The amount of players exceded the Golden Age. This era was shortlived however, as rife competition at spawn led to new players not being able to get a foothold. However, this world marked a return to the famed ice highways and megabases Chulls is known for. One such megabase, LemGetLol, featured the famed Chico_Guapo, NuggetBro, an inactive player Veggieelol, and LemonDude123. This was home to the Second Arch, mountain bridges, the MTV Logo, the second Dirty Dock, and mountain top cottages. WamBamSam also created a replica of the famed Treehouse, paying homage to his first ever build on the server. YaBoyPayden's friend JakeYouOut, who we haven't covered, also returned.</p>
