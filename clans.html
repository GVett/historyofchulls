		<h2>CLANS</h2>
		<p>This era of Chulls history followed directly after the First World. This was the precursor to the Golden Age and many important events occured that still are known to this day. In these days, new players joined in the form of Prii5m and Scott's Legion. Scott, the tyrant of Chulls, was most successful in this era and recieved his first ban. YaBoyPayden is responsible for Scott's tyranny, inviting him to the server in the first place. However, Prii5m and NuggetBro, menaces of their own degree, eventually overpowered Scott and his devious ways. This era was known for the lack of builds and decentralization, as well as the Netherrack Wastes outside of spawn. This world was also the main time SaucySacrifice and Zorg were active.</p>
